The content was not intended for any circulation past transfer to one recipient for police report.

Since the video was fuzzy and suspect difficult to identify, it was assumed there was no harm to individual and the information could be [Level 1 â€” Public](https://library.municode.com/ca/la_county_-_bos/codes/board_policy?nodeId=CH6INTE_6.104INCLPO). But there was no reason to circulate anything beyond just transfer to police report.

The videos went to the repo for the following reasons. First, a direct upload to [website](https://lasd.org/sorts) did not succeed. 
Selecting yes to the option "Are there any photos or videos of the incident occurring?" resulted in an instruction to contact local station. A station was contacted and front office clerk was helpful and courteous. Although the clerk was excellent, clerk was not equipped to accept a USB delivery of videos. It was assumed a division of roles between clerk and a media group meant USB transfer was not optimal.

At least one file size was too large for Short Message System (SMS) / text and gmail attachment. So videos were not sent by these common means.
