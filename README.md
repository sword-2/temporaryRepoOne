## Comments

There are 3 mp4 videos from Saturday 14 Sep 2024 showing bicycle stolen:

01\_arrive.mp4. In this video, the suspect rides in on own bicycle. The theft was not out of need for a bicycle, since the suspect already had their own working bicycle.

02\_stealBike.mp4. In this video, the suspect eventually takes the sign off the top of the post and lifts bicycle over the top of the pole. Suspect attempts to wheel away bike, but quickly discovers the wheels do not roll as the lock is fastened around both wheels. Therefore suspect puts bicycle over top of their own bicycle.

## Scriptures

Some scriptures could not be lived out.
	Exodus 20:15 (LSB) You shall not steal. Since the bike was already stolen, it was too late to live out the verse, at least for this month.
	Matthew 18:15 (LSB) Now if your brother sins, go and show him his fault, between you and him alone; if he listens to you, you have won your brother. This verse could not be lived out since it was not known how to locate the suspect.
